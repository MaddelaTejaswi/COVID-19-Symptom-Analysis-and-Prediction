# COVID-19 Symptom Analysis and Prediction

The project "COVID-19 Symptom Analysis and Prediction" aims to develop a robust symptom checker and analysis tool to assist in early detection and management of COVID-19. 

By exploring symptom data, the project will identify prevalence, severity, and demographic patterns, enabling insights into symptom dynamics and their impact on disease outcomes. 

Key objectives include assessing symptom prevalence, analyzing temporal and geographic variations, understanding symptom-outcome relationships, and integrating findings into predictive models. 

The project seeks to enhance public health interventions through data-driven recommendations and improve diagnostic and treatment strategies for COVID-19.
